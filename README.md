NEW - You now dismember heads with headshots and can dismember limbs with certain tools/weapons. A big thanks to drconfused1 for bringing this idea to my attention.
NEW - New version that works with Firearms mod by Mayic.
NEW - 2 new version that only apply dismemberments to guns and bows (projectiles). One for vanilla, the other for Firearms mod by Mayic.

NOTE: Pairs well with More Zombies per Biome (x2 x4 x8 x16) A17

One hit headshot kills with:
-All firearms/bows
-Hunting Knife
-Iron/Steel Axes
-Iron/Steel Picks
-Iron Club
-Machete
-Sledgehammer
-Chainsaw
-Auger

These Tools/Weapons will dismember limbs:
-Iron/Steel axe - dismember limbs
-Mechete - dismember limbs
-Chainsaw - dismember limbs
-Shotgun w/shell - 50% chance to dismember limbs
-Shotgun w/Slug - dismember limbs
-Blunderbus - 30% chance to dismember limbs

Firearms Edition:
-All Guns - One hit Headshot dismemberment
-Golden Gun - dismember limbs
-M82 (50cal) - dismember limbs
-20g Shotgun - 30% chance to dismember limbs
-Chaingun (5mm)- 25% chance to dismember limbs
-M249 SAW (5.56x45mm) - 25% chance to dismember limbs

FUN FACT: You can now dismember all limbs on a zombie and keep it alive with only its head and torso! It will still bite you if you get near its head!

NOTE: I left some xpaths in there, commented out, to add dismemberment to explosives but don't know how to get it to work as an "area of effect". The rocket was left out because dismemberment would have to be a direct hit to the head/limb to work.
